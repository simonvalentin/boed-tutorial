# Designing Optimal Experiments Using Machine Learning

This repository provides notebooks for running a minimal example end-to-end and replicating all figures presented in the paper. 

## TODOs
- [ ] Finish notebooks
  - [ ] Toy-example simulation
  - [ ] Simulation study
  - [ ] Human-participant study
- [ ] Provide instructions for scaling up method
- [ ] (Optional) Build minimal version of experiment that doesn't save data and put on repo. 
- [ ] (Optional) Create static (github.io or netlify) page that provides html-rendered versions of the notebooks. 
- [ ] (Optional) Create google colab links (note might require setting up the environment appropriately).
